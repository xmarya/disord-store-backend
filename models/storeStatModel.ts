/*TODO:
  1- the logic to handle the stores' profit is going to be inside invoiceModels's post middleware.
  so it will be automatic operation without the need
  to create middleware and a route to handle it after handling the invoice.
  also and the most important thing is TO BATCH the profits.

  2- Make a cron task to: 
    a) start a new day.
    b) start a new week.
    c) start a new month.
    d) start a new year.
    e) transfer/insert the totalProfits field to annualProfit Model (acts like an archive).
    f) reset/delete the whole records in storeState Model.

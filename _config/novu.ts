    NOVU CONCEPTS:
    1- workflow: how notifications are sent. it's the logic and the blueprint of each type of noti is going to use
    2- subscriber: the one who should receive the message
    3- topic: is a way to group subscribers together,so they can be notified about the event together at once
            to send a noti for a topic-group- instead of an individual, write the topicâ€™s unique key in the `to` field inside the workflow trigger
    5- channel: represent a configured provider such as Resend, SandGrid
